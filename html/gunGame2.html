      Obviously a rewrite the gun playing game. The project actually had two
      versions. The first was before I fucked it all up, and the other was after
      I fucked it all up. At first, the rewrite was meant to rewrite everything
      but still keep the same premise. I then got side-tracted by creating a
      save point system, which took like a lot of my time, I would say 2 weeks
      before I got it working. It was pretty impressive for me to get it
      working, since this was my first time dealing with files (in the sense of
      actually writing to a file and reading from it), and the only reason I was
      dealing with files in the first place was because I wanted to make it
      permanently stay on the user's storage unless the user somehow deletes it.
      Now after I got that working, I realized that I was using C++, and it had
      OOPs. This is where the project blew up, like literally. I made a lot of
      classes, one for each monster and two for players. The intention was to
      have the monster's/player's attack loop through until the player or
      monster was down, then decrease the count. However, it just took a lot of
      time coding it, and so I scrapped it, for now.
