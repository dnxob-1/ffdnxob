    <h1>The classes I am taking as a student</h1>

    <p>
      If you did not already, know (probably), I am a student. I would say at
      the time of making this I still am a student, but I am always a student,
      even after I graduate a university.
    </p>
    <p>
      During high school, I am taking or have taken 18-19 advanced placement
      classes. These are considered to be college level classes. I am also
      planning on taking the SAT and ACT. I hope I do well on both.

    <p>
      Heres a list of all the AP classes: Human Geography, Psychology, Japanese
      Language and Culture, Biology, Computer Science A, English Literature and
      Composition, Macroeconomics, U.S. Government & Politics, European History,
      Chemistry, US History, English language and Composition, Statistics,
      Calculus BC, Physics C: Mechanics, Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism,
      Computer Science Principles, World History: Modern.

      Now if you're wondering about my high school GPA. Well...Lets just say
      that it's not the best. Currently as a Junior, the GPA is around a 2.5
      weighted. You might be wondering, how? During my freshman year, I did
      pretty poorly in school. It wasn't really due to my intelligence level,
      but because of other personal factors that I cannot share here. It was
      also partly due to the fact that we just had covid and I came back after
      two years of being online which caused me to adjust a little bit slower. I
      would like to note that I also only took/take honors or AP classes. In
      that year, I told myself that I would get only D's the entire year, which
      did happen for two trimesters, one of the trimesters I got all C's. At
      that time I did not really care about grades and what not, and to this day
      I still do not value grades or GPA as much as everyone else. I view GPA as
      a reflection of your work ethic. You will have a high GPA if you just
      spend more time focusing on school work and studying for exams. This isn't
      my ideal way of learning, since I like to learn things of my own accord
      and at my own pace. Like I finished all of AP Calculus BC in the span of a
      month and I memorized at least 75% of the content because I was learning
      it for myself and not because someone told me to learn it. Anyway, I also
      like to do things outside of school, like programming, or learning more
      programming things, or learning more math. Speaking about math. Currently,
      as of writing this, I am taking a new class called real analysis, because
      I just finished calculus 3, which was not fun by the way, after real
      analysis (baby rudin), I am thinking of taking complex analysis (ahlfors),
      then maybe something else? I do not really know the classes undergrads
      take nowadays.
