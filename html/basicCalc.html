      As you can tell from the very descriptive title, this is a "basic"
      calculator. It really isn't that much basic now. You see, at first, after
      finishing learning python, I was like, python is a number's programming
      language. And so the first idea I came up with was to make a word
      corrector, but that went out the window when I had to use different
      modules and it got pretty complicated. Then I came up with the great idea
      of making a calculator from scratch. Initially, it could only perform 4
      operations, with only two numbers. Now, it has two files, one file has the
      four operations with even more operations, but you can't really input as
      many numbers as you want. The other file, has only 2 operations, adding
      and subtracting. But this file can take as many inputs as you want. The
      project explores the use of string splitting the user input, use of many
      elif statements, and the math modules. This was all, of course, before
      knowing that there was an eval() for python, and I did not really need to
      build a calculator from scratch in the first place.
