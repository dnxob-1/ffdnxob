      Hello! This was my first ever project. Unlike the other ones, this one
      actually has a backstory. Basically, after finishing learning C, I asked
      my dad what kind of project I should do, and he told me to make something
      that predicts the powerball chances. Of course this is impossible, instead
      I made a mock version of the powerball. Truly, I do not know how powerball
      works, I modeled it after what my dad told me. Anyway, the program uses
      rand() a lot which is fine I guess. I actually recently reworked the
      program, so there is no redundancy in the code.
