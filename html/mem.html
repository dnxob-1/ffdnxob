      This honestly was a pretty decent project. It has a save system, a redo
      system, and it also uses pointers. The project actually hurt my brain a
      little bit, but it was pretty fun. It was also my first time working
      seriously with pointers, so I got a lot of dangling pointers and seg
      faults. It also dealt with error handling and had a lot of files.
