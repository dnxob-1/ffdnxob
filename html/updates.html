      Well. Here it is. I am finally done with this project. Now what? What will
      I do with this project that I am done with it? Of course update it!
      Although it might not be frequent, and I sometimes may forget about it, I
      will try to update it when I can.

      This page will obviously contain the changes done to this site. Later
      though, because I am now tired.

      I would like to add, I finished real analysis. It did not end well. Now
      I've changed my learning method for learning mathematics, I now take notes
      and try to attempt the exercises. I am also practically half-way done with
      my complex analysis book, so far, pretty good.
