      This was my second project, and my attempt to write a game. I had many
      ambitious goals at the end, but I got lazy and stopped working on it,
      which is fine. What's interesting about this project is that it explores
      many new things, like color, error handling, player input, use of multiple
      files, and cause/effect. It wasn't the best thing but, pretty nice as a
      second project.

      Heres the link to the project:
      <a
        href="https://github.com/dnxob-1/Gun-playing-game/tree/main"
        target="_blank"
        >Gun-playing-game</a
      >
    </p>

      I actually do not have the files of this project on my machine currently
      because I switched to linux, and I made this project before using linux,
      and so I do not have a pic of the output of the files. You can obviously
      copy the code from the repo.
