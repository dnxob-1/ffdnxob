      Nothing much else to say here other than this was pretty much a failed
      project. The intention was to make it so that you have a login system with
      a database that stores it. But that plan did not last since it took me
      longer than expected to get mysql working on linux, and then having to
      code the thing afterward just killed it. And so it kinda just looks like a
      regular login and signup page but without actual login or signups going
      on. It's kinda sad too, since this project was supposed to be the first
      full-stack project, with front-end and back-end development.

      By the way. The show passwords were previously working, but I guess they
      also broke when my mind did.
