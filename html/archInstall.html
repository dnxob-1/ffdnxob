      This will serve as a guide to installing archlinux if you are a windows
      user. First of all, lets start with some prereqs. Most of these need to be
      checked out or else it just won't work. (it's okay to have lower ram or
      storage, it just will be a bit laggier)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A usb stick (with preferably 64 GiBs of storage)</li>
      <li>A computer with at least 250 GiBs of storage</li>
      <li>A system that has at least 6 GiBs of random access memory (RAM)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that that is out of the way. Lets go!</p>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
      Download balena etcher or rufus. In my personal experience, I did not have
      a good time with balena etcher and so I used rufus. But
      <strong>please</strong> pick whichever works for you.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com/iso/2024.11.01/"
        id="downloadArchIso"
        >Download</a
      >
      the archlinux .iso file. The second one would be the one you would
      download, 'archlinux-2024.11.01-x86_64.iso' or this one
      'archlinux-x86_64.iso'.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Move the iso file into your usb and use balena etcher or rufus on that usb
      and configure your settings there depending on whether your system is
      BIOS, or UEFI. You are basically making a bootable usb. After doing, you
      should get some other files other than your iso file inside your usb.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      Make sure to have disabled secure boot for your computer. You have to
      figure out how to get into your BIOS or UEFI menu for your specific
      computer. After that, just find the secure boot option and make sure that
      it is disabled. If your computer says that this is dangerous, don't worry
      about it. All that secure boot does, is that it makes it so that when your
      computer starts, there are no virus or things that run when your computer
      starts, basically.
      <strong
        >Disabling secure boot is very IMPORTANT. Archlinux WILL NOT run if it
        is enabled.</strong
      >
      During this time, you might also want to change the boot order, and make
      your usb be the primary boot. That way, if your usb is in, then it will
      always boot from the usb first, and not from windows. (Optional). You
      probably won't have to do step 6 if you do this, and it successfully
      boots. Just restart your computer after step 5
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
      Open disk management. Find your disk. Right click on it, then click on
      shrink volume. Find "Enter amount of space to shrink in MB", and have at
      least 40 GiBs, or more, put in there. Then click shrink.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>
      Go to your boot menu, by either searching for it or pressing a designated
      key on your keyboard while windows is starting (This is usually the F8
      key). Click on Use a Device, find your usb, and click it.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>
      If everything worked correctly, you should soon see an archlinux menu.
      Click the install medium. Then connect to the internet. Type in these
      following commands:
    </p>
    <a>iwctl</a>
    <p>Then</p>
    <a>device list</a>
    <p>to find your device that connects to the internet (usually is wlan0).</p>
    <a>station wlan0 scan</a> <a>station wlan0 get-networks</a>
    <p>Then connect to the desired network by using</p>
    <a>station wlan0 connect ""</a>
    <p>
      (put the name of the network in the ""). Ping a website to check if the
      internet is working. For example
    </p>
    <a>ping google.com</a>
    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>
      Next up, we have to partition the usb. The usb will be partitioned
      (divided) into three parts. The First is going to be for the bootloader
      and other important system things. The second will be for swap, which is
      like backup ram in case your system starts using up too much ram.
      Remember, it's not new/extra ram, it's still the ram in your system. The
      third and final one will be for the linux filesystem. This last one will
      have the most data allocated to it since it's where you're actual files
      will be located. Here's how much storage you should put in each one:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For the boot sector, it is recommended to have 512 MiBs, which can be
        typed as 512M. You can put more here if you're going to download more
        linux kernels. But I would only recommend 1 GiBs. Which can be written
        as 1G
      </li>
      <li>
        For the swap, this really depends on your actual ram. You should
        probably allocate half of your actual ram to that. For example, if you
        have 12G, put 6G for the swap.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly we have the linux filesystem. This can have however much is left
        from the allocation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's how you would do it. Type in the command line</p>
    <a>cfdisk</a>
    <p>
      This will open a menu. Hopefully you will be able to see your usb
      partition. If you see something like NVMe, that is most likely your actual
      disk on your computer, usually the usb is sda, but it can also be NVMe.
      Press on delete. This should then turn into "free space". Afterward, press
      on new, then partition the amount recommended, press type, find EFI
      system, click on it. Then hover over "free space" once more, press new,
      allocate the amount recommended, press type, find linux swap. Finally,
      press new, allocate the recommended amount, press type, then linux
      filesystem. Press write, to write everything.
    </p>
    <p>Use the following commands to finish up the process.</p>
    <a>mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3</a>
    <p>
      /dev/sda1 should be whichever partition that you just partitioned with
      cfdisk that has the linux filesystem, this is also called the root
      partition. That command turns the filesystem to filesys-type ext4, which
      is a format for the files.
    </p>
    <a>mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1</a>
    <p>
      This one is for your efi system or just your boot sector. It turns it into
      fat32, another file format. The last two are for the swap.
    </p>
    <a>mkswap /dev/sda2</a> <a>swapon /dev/sda2</a>
    <p>Make sure to change the sda's with your corresponding ones.</p>
    <h3>Step 9</h3>
    <p>Make two directories (folders), using</p>
    <a>mkdir /mnt</a>
    <p>and</p>
    <a>mkdir /mnt/boot</a>
    <p>
      The /mnt is for your entire filesystem, while the boot is where you are
      going to put all of your boot related things, like grub.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mount your root partition to /mnt and your boot sector to your /mnt/boot,
      using the following commands:
    </p>
    <a>mount /dev/sda3 /mnt</a>
    <p>and</p>
    <a>mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot</a>
    <h3>Step 10</h3>
    <p>Install the base packages</p>
    <a>pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware vim</a>
    <p>
      generate the fstab, which contains the uuids for things that are like
      usbs, root (/), and the boot sector. You can add modifiers to the things
      mentioned.
    </p>
    <a>genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab</a>
    <p>and chroot in there</p>
    <a>arch-chroot /mnt</a>.
    <h3>Step 11</h3>
    <p>Configure the system. Set the timezone</p>
    <a>ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/theRegion/theCity /etc/localtime</a>
    <p>
      Replace theRegion and theCity with yours. I kinda forgot how to see which
      cities and regions are available
    </p>
    <a>hwclock --systohc</a>
    <p>to sync the time. Now is the time to set the locale.</p>
    <a>nano /etc/locale.conf</a>
    <p>
      Do this command and find 'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8', remove the '#' that is at
      the start of that line. Generate the locale
    </p>
    <a>locale-gen</a>
    <p>and then</p>
    <a>echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf</a>
    <p>if you're using English. Set the host name by</p>
    <a>echo "thehostname" > /etc/hostname</a>
    <p>
      replace thehostname with whatever hostname you want. Set the root's
      password.
    </p>
    <a>passwd</a>
    <p>Don't forget your password.</p>
    <h3>Step 12</h3>
    <p>Now time to install grub, the bootloader.</p>
    <a>pacman -S grub efibootmgr nano</a>
    <p>Then</p>
    <a
      >grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot
      --bootloader-id=GRUB</a
    >
    <p>Finally do,</p>
    <a>grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</a>
    <p>
      Now you're basically done with the install. But you could always install a
      few packages and do some extra things before leaving...
    </p>
    <h3>Step 13</h3>
    <p>Here's a command to use</p>
    <a
      >pacman -S networkmanager vim ntfs-3g dosfstools sudo wget curl
      xorg-server xorg-xinit os-prober base-devel git python python-pip perl
      clang lld btop sysstat gcc rsync zip unzip tar gzip zstd</a
    >
    <p>
      You can also add a user to your system. Using root is often frowned upon,
      so it's best to use a user.
    </p>
    <a>useradd -m -G wheel theusername</a>
    <p>and then add a password to it</p>
    <a>passwd theusername</a>.
    <p>replace theusername with your own username that you want.</p>
    <p>Do</p>
    <a>nano /etc/sudoers</a>
    <p>and remove the '#' from the start of the line</p>
    <a>%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL</a>
    <h3>Step 14</h3>
    <p>That should do it. Now you can exit chroot by using</p>
    <a>exit</a>
    <p>
      Afterward, you should restart and then you should get booted into
      archlinux once more. The recommended actions to take after logging in, is
      to install a window-manager or desktop environment, examples include
      hyprland dwm, i3 for window-managers, and kde plasma, gnome for desktop
      environment. To install them you need to type in
    </p>
    <a>sudo pacman -S packages</a>
    <p>replace packages with your desired packages.</p>
