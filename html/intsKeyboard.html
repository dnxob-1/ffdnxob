      Pain. We feel it a lot, and I felt it with this one. This and the next
      project after this one were huge jumps in C. Having to learning what the
      hell was uint64_t, inline asm, what the io.h was with inb, outb, and
      io_wait, and what an IDT, ISR, PIC, APIC, GDT, LIDT, were. It was not a
      good time. Even if I got a little bit of help for all of this.

      Heres the link to the project:

      Can't really show pics as this needs some other circumstances for it to
      run.
