          Hi. My name is Allen (actual name is Ali). I am a computer scientist.
          I enjoy making things, making these things can be hard sometimes, but
          I enjoy doing so. Not only am I a computer scientist, but I am also a
          student who studies things such as
          <a

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"
            target="_blank"
            >mathematics</a
          >,
          <a
            id="physicsLink"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"
            target="_blank"
            >physics</a
          >,
          <a
            id="japLink"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"
            target="_blank"
            >Japanese</a

          <a

            target="_blank"
            >computer science</a
          >. Now, although I do not have a sophisticated plethora of personal
          projects, I at least have some projects that I can somewhat be proud
          of, something is better than nothing, right? This website is actually
          a project in it of itself, except this project is semi-serious. On
          this website and while building this, I hope to accomplish a few
          things, first is to demonstrate my projects vocally, second is to make
          my projects kinda show the learning experience, third is to talk about
          myself more as a student, and finally is to have fun with this
          project.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks!</p>
